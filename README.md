# Fornacem

* Fornacem is Minecraft Forge mod project that targets adding more smelting options into the game
* As **I** (the leading developer) **am new** to creating Minecraft mods, please **be patient** with me
* You can write any suggestion as the issues, please, describe them ***as much as you humanly can***
* Same goes for any bugs, general problems and such

---

## Features 
- [ ] Create some basic options for smelting
- [ ] Create blocks for multipart buildings
- [ ] Figure out the *~fluids~*
- [ ] Casting
- [ ] ~~Tools~~ (not sure about this one)
- [ ] Other mod compatibility

*(As you could tell, not much is done and so, any help is appreciated)*

---

## Releases 
* All stable available versions can be found in *releases* here on Github
* If you want the ***bleeding edge*** don't be afraid and try to build one yourself

### Building
* Be sure you have Java 8+ installed
* For building use bundled gradlew
* In Windows use: `gradlew.bat build`
    * If some terrible thing comes out try `gradlew.bat clean build` before posting an issue
* In Linux: `bash gradlew build` and again, if something fails, try `clean build` first
